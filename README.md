# Python-wikEdDiff

WikEdDiff is a visual inline-style difference engine with block move support.

The original wikEdDiff is an improved JavaScript diff library that returns
html/css-formatted new text version with highlighted deletions, insertions,
and block moves. It is also available as a MediaWiki extension, wich is a
one-to-one synced port with changes and fixes are applied to both versions.

**Python-wikEdDiff** is a port of the original JavaScript library to Python.
There were no changes to the algorithm, so all credits go to the original
author, [Cacycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cacycle).
